## How well did it work?

Pretty well. DeepSeek will take longer to try and correct user errors compared to other models though.

## Paste a few input/output combos

#### "My name is Geoffrey. I am an engineer, I am 21, and I am single."
```python
name='Geoffrey' occupation='engineer' age=21 taken=False hometown='Unknown'
```

#### "I'm Steve. For a living, I do mining. I'm from right here in Austin, Texas where I live with my wife. I turned 33 last week"
```python

```

#### "Okay so I'm Lt. Junhyung Park of the U.S. Air Force. I was born in Seoul, South Korea. I'm 23 now. I'm talking to one girl but I'm not in a relationship yet"
